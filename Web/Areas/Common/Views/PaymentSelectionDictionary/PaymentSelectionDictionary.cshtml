                     <p>
                        This is used for Outpatient and Physician claims. The main two components of a basic fee schedule is the CPT code and the dollar rate associated with that code. If that code is present on a claim, then the reimbursement should be that dollar rate linked to that code on the fee schedule.
                     </p>

                     <h3> Example </h3>
                     <p>
                       CPT 36415 is $3.00 on the Fee Schedule. It is on the claim one time. Then the reimbursement for that particular code is $3.00. This is just for that line item reimbursement. The claim could get further reimbursement in addition to the $3.00.

                     <p>
                        This is a fee schedule where the HCPCS/CPT codes are assigned to a grouper (typically 0-20) and each of the grouper numbers will have a payment flat rate assigned to it. If that code is present on the claim, then it will receive a percentage of that flat rate. The percentage is based on a decreasing tier percentage method of which the most common method is 100% for primary, 50% for secondary, and 25% for tertiary and possibly subsequent. The determining factor to define what is primary, secondary, or tertiary is the order of highest payment amount listed in the fee schedule for that assigned grouper number for that code on the claim.
                     </p>

                     <h3> Example </h3>
                     <p>
                        Grouper Number->CPT/HCPCS->Present on claim->determine which codes have highest payment rate associated with their Grouper Number->apply any multi percentage method.

                            Usually applies to all services and is listed in the fine print of a contract. This rule simply states that the payer will pay either the lesser of the calculated reimbursement for that service or  100% of total charges, whichever amount is smaller.

                            If the contract states for all Inpatient claims, it will pay on a Per Diem of $1500 per day, and the patient was in for 2 days, so the calculated reimbursement would be $1500*2 = $3000, but the claims total charges for that claim is only $2800, then the payer is only going to pay $2800.

                        Stop Loss-Basic </h2>
                        <p>
                            If listed in a contract, it is typically for either all services or just for Inpatient services. There are usually three components used in the calculation of a Stop Loss. There is a Threshold, a Percentage, and the Total Charges on the claim.
                        </p>

                        <h3> Example </h3>

                        <p>
                        If the Payer defines the threshold as $50,000, and the claim total charges exceeds this amount and is $51,000, then that claim has just met the criteria to reimburse based on the stop loss. The formula would be if the percentage is 80%, then $51,000*.80=$40,800. $40,800 would be the total reimbursement because typically, any other reimbursement that got calculated for this type of claim is usually overridden by the Stop Loss reimbursement. Essentially, Stop Loss is not consisted as a Carve Out reimbursement.
